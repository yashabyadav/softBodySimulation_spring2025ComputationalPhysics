\section{Introduction}
The spring-mass model is a well-established and computationally manageable approach for simulating soft bodies. It uses systems of coupled ODEs that can be integrated with solvers from the OSP library. Unlike the more computationally demanding Finite Element Method, this model allows rapid iteration, easier debugging, and better integration with OSP’s visualization tools.

This approach enables meaningful physical analysis (e.g., energy dissipation, deformation dynamics, fluctuation behavior).

The general goal of this project is to use basic physics principles to come up with a model and apply it to produce physically (or at least visully) accurate soft body simulations. I'll stick to the object oriented practices and problem solving approach discussed in the class.
