The simulation is restricted to two dimensions and in spirits of being object oriented, I wrote a utility package to work with 2D vectors that can be scaled upon in the future.
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\subsection{Vec2D}
Rather than using two variables for each vector (e.g. $x$ and $y$ for position), I made an object \texttt{vec2}, containing both the components.
The class file contains methods for standard vector operations, for example the dot product:
\begin{lstlisting}
public double dot(vec2 other){
    return (this.x*other.x)+(this.y*other.y);
}
\end{lstlisting}
The entire \texttt{Vec2D.java} file can be found in code listings.\par

The OSP differential equation interfaces are written to work with scalers and cannot work with \texttt{vec2} objects. That is, if I want to solve a vector differential equation, say:
\begin{align}
    \frac{d \vec{r}}{dt} = A \vec{r}
\end{align}
\\
where $\vec{\mathbf{r}} = r_{x} \hat{i}+r_{y} \hat{j}$
I would need the differential equation separately for $r_{x}$ and $r_{y}$:\\
\begin{align}
     \frac{dr_{x}}{dt} = A {r_{x}}\\
     \frac{dr_{y}}{dt} = A {r_{y}}
\end{align}
\\

To directly use the differential equation pipline of OSP, I modified the classes: \texttt{AbstractODESolver, ODE, ODESolver, Verlet} to work directly with \texttt{vec2} type objects. These modified classes are also a part of the Utils package and are listed in codeListings section.
