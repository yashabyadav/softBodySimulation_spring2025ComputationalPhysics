\subsection{Shape and justification}


One of the most common ways to simulate soft bodies in physical simualations and video games is a system of masses connected via damped springs in a configuration mimicking a soft body. As a starting point, I choose the configuration as shown in the figure <insert figure reference>, where the blue node in the center represents the "center of mass" of this soft body, and the red "surface nodes" representing the general shape of the soft body at a given instant. The surface nodes are connected to their immediate neighbors with springs of stiffness $k$ represented with black lines and each surface node is attached to the center of mass node with springs of stiffness $k_{2}$ represented by green lines.
