abstract = {A curriculum resource designed around interactive computer-based modeling brings
computational physics to students of all levels. Scientists routinely use computer modeling and computation in innovative
research, including predicting the nature of He4 at extremely low temperatures
and the impact of human activity on climate. Why does computer-based modeling
remain absent from many educational programs?}}
